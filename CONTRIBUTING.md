2. **Update the CHANGELOG.md** with a note describing your changes
3. **The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off** of at least one other developer

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Use conventional commit messages** (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: resolve bug`)
- **Keep PRs focused** - one feature or bug fix per PR
- **Write clear commit messages** that explain what and why, not how
- **Include tests** for new features when possible
- **Update documentation** if you're changing APIs or adding features

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Add proper type annotations
- Avoid using `any` type - use proper types instead
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use enums for constants

### Svelte/SvelteKit

- Use Svelte 5 syntax when possible
- Follow SvelteKit conventions for file naming and structure
- Use TypeScript in Svelte files (`<script lang="ts">`)
- Keep components small and focused
- Use props for component communication

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Keep styles responsive and accessible

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components and classes
- Use kebab-case for file names

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Write tests for bug fixes
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Keep tests simple and focused

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
